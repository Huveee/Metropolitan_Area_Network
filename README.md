# Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) Simulation

This project involves the design and simulation of a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) using Cisco Packet Tracer, as part of the CME 3204 Data Communications and Computer Networks course. The simulation includes various scenarios to demonstrate network functionality and analyze traffic across multiple facilities and branches.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a MAN that connects two distinct branch offices in a city through routers over an ISP. Each branch consists of three different facilities with specific network requirements and configurations, ranging from workstations and servers to wireless and mobile devices.

## Features

- Design of a MAN with detailed network architecture.
- Simulation of real-world network activities like web browsing, email handling, and file transfer.
- Use of Cisco Packet Tracer for network modeling and simulation.
- Inclusion of various network devices such as routers, switches, servers, and various types of clients.

## Scenarios

This project includes several predefined simulation scenarios, such as:
1. A wireless user browsing the web and reading emails.
2. A VoIP conference call between workstation users.
3. File transfers to and from an FTP server across the network.

Additional custom scenarios developed for this project are also included to demonstrate the network's capabilities and performance under different conditions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer) to run the simulation files.
- Basic understanding of network design and topology.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```
2. Open the `.pka` or `.pkz` files in Cisco Packet Tracer.

### Running the Simulations

Load the desired simulation file in Cisco Packet Tracer and follow the instructions within the file to start the simulation. Each scenario is documented for easy testing and verification.
